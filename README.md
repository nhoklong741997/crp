# Crystal Report .NET

## What is Crystal Report?
  Crystal Reports is a report design tool that allows you to create reports capable of retrieving and formatting a result set from a database or other data source.
  
## What Can You Do with Crystal Reports .NET?
  Crystal Reports .NET includes an integrated Report Designer available within the Visual Studio IDE that you can use to create report files (.rpt) to integrate with your application.
  This report designer features a number of experts (or wizards) to help you get started creating a report. It will guide you through the report development process, from selecting a data source and the field that will appear on your report, to determining what records should appear.
  Once you have a basic report designed, you can then add features like formula fields, running totals, graphs, and so on to make your report design as complex as required. Reports come in all shapes, sizes, and forms. You may want to create a report that can be used to print an invoice from your application, to compile statistics for a management report, or to produce an inventory count sheet.
